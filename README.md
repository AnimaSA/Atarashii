DreadfulMAL - MAL for ICS+
==============

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE:

1. Everything

More specifically, pressing issues are:

1. Store loaded data into database
2. Lazy load images, also store them so we only load them once
3. Update getAnimeList ASyncTask and called methods to reflect and use stored data if available
