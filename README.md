Atarashii! - A Modern MAL for Android
=====================================

The goal of Atarashii! is to be a modern Material-themed client for the
MyAnimeList.net & AniList.co website. It supports Android 4.0 and newer. While still in
active development, it already is fully featured and polished. You can download
it from [the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=net.somethingdreadful.MAL&c=apps).

Atarashii! is BSD licensed and contributions are welcome.


Project Goals
-------------
The goal of Atarashii! is to be the best designed and overall best application
for MAL and AL on Android devices. This is acomplished with a user-first approach,
with a focus on design. The application must be fast, easy to use, and feel
and look like it's part of Android. None of these things should mean a tradeoff
with functionality; the design and functionality should enhance and inform each
other.

In short, the developers are users too. We're making something we would like to
use, as users.
