DreadfulMAL - MAL for ICS+
==============

Project Goals:
To be the best MAL client for ICS+ devices. The project takes a user-first approach, with a focus on design.
The app should be easy to use, feel good, and most of all look good. None of this however means a tradeoff in functionality.
All the functionality that a user would come to expect from a MAL app will be here, in ways that will pleasantly surprise.

In short, the devs are users too. We're making something we would like to use, as users.

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE:

1. Not quite everything :D

More specifically, pressing issues are:

1. Finish manga support
2. Better detail view layout

Things that are DONE:

1. All KINDS of stuff <3
