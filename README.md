Atarashii! - MAL for ICS+
==============

Project Goals:
To be the best MAL client for ICS+ devices. The project takes a user-first approach, with a focus on design.
The app should be fast, easy to use, feel good, and definitely look good. None of this however should mean a tradeoff in functionality.
All the functionality that a user would come to expect from a MAL app will be here, in ways that will pleasantly surprise.

In short, the devs are users too. We're making something we would like to use, as users.
