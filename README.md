DreadfulMAL - MAL for ICS+
==============

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE:

1. Not quite everything :D

More specifically, pressing issues are:

1. Display more info in DetailView (layout update needed, basically)
2. Things to actually write to MAL, currently we only read

Things that are DONE:

1. Lazy load images, also store them so we only load them once [<3 ImageDownloader and TheAndroidCoder]
2. Store + read initial sync in/from database.
3. Basic DetailView implementation
