DreadfulMAL - MAL for ICS+
==============

Project Goals:
To be the best MAL client for ICS+ devices. The project takes a user-first approach, with a focus on design.
The app should be easy to use, feel good, and most of all look good. None of this however means a tradeoff in functionality.
All the functionality that a user would come to expect from a MAL app will be here, in ways that will pleasantly surprise.

In short, the devs are users too. We're making something we would like to use, as users.

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE:

1. Not quite everything :D

More specifically, pressing issues are:

1. Display more info in DetailView (layout update needed, basically) (almost done)
2. Things to actually write to MAL (Almost done)

Things that are DONE:

1. Lazy load images, also store them so we only load them once [<3 ImageDownloader and TheAndroidCoder]
2. Store + read initial sync in/from database.
3. Basic DetailView implementation
