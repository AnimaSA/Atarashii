DreadfulMAL - MAL for ICS+
==============

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE:

1. Everything

More specifically, pressing issues are:

1. Store more things. This is like half done. I'm lazy and didn't write the extra lines to store as much as I could have from the initial sync.

Things that are DONE:

1. Lazy load images, also store them so we only load them once [<3 ImageDownloader and TheAndroidCoder]
2. Store + read initial sync in/from database.
